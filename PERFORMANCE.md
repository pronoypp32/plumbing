# Performance Optimizations Applied

## Site Performance Improvements

### 1. **Font Loading Optimizations**
- Added `display: swap` to Inter font for faster text rendering
- Added proper font preload in HTML head
- Fixed font fallback chain for better text rendering
- Added `text-rendering: optimizeLegibility` for crisp text

### 2. **Next.js Configuration Optimizations**
- Enabled `compress: true` for gzip compression
- Added image optimization with WebP and AVIF formats
- Enabled experimental `optimizeCss` for better CSS performance
- Enabled `optimizeServerReact` for server-side optimizations
- Added console removal in production builds

### 3. **Animation Performance**
- Reduced animation durations from 0.6s to 0.4s
- Added `viewport={{ once: true }}` to prevent re-animation on scroll
- Simplified animation easing for better performance
- Reduced stagger delays for faster loading

### 4. **CSS Optimizations**
- Added `scroll-behavior: smooth` for better scrolling
- Improved font smoothing with `-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased`
- Added `font-feature-settings` for better typography
- Added `prefers-reduced-motion` support for accessibility

### 5. **Component Optimizations**
- Removed heavy scale transforms from buttons
- Optimized transition properties to use only colors
- Added loading components for better perceived performance
- Created performance hooks for window size detection

## Performance Metrics

### Before Optimizations:
- Server startup: ~2-3 seconds
- Heavy animations causing layout shifts
- Font loading blocking text rendering
- No image optimization

### After Optimizations:
- Server startup: ~2 seconds with optimizations
- Smooth animations with reduced complexity
- Non-blocking font loading with proper fallbacks
- Optimized images with modern formats (WebP, AVIF)

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Lazy Loading**: Components load only when needed
2. **Font Optimization**: Proper font loading strategies
3. **Image Optimization**: Modern formats and responsive sizing
4. **Animation Performance**: Reduced complexity and GPU acceleration
5. **CSS Optimization**: Efficient selectors and properties
6. **JavaScript Optimization**: Reduced bundle size and faster execution

## Monitoring Performance

To monitor performance:
```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm run start

# Analyze bundle (if needed)
npm install @next/bundle-analyzer
```

## Additional Recommendations

1. **CDN Usage**: Consider using a CDN for static assets
2. **Caching**: Implement proper caching headers
3. **Code Splitting**: Further split components for better loading
4. **Service Worker**: Add PWA features for offline support
5. **Database Optimization**: Optimize any API calls when backend is added
